## Current State of App

The app is still in development. As of now users can register, login, view articles, comment on articles and upvote/downvote articles. If a user leaves the page, the session is stored in a cookie.

The following features still need implementing:
- Dashboard page
- Posting an article
- Articles pagination
- Upvote/downvote of comments

(Please refer to the wireframe in this repo for an overview of these features)

Also, there are some improvements to be made in regards to design and responsiveness.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `node 18.15.0 LTS +` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

## Notes on CORS

At the moment, CORS is enabled in backend with a list of two allowed origins: 
- https://nc-top-news.netlify.app
- http://localhost:3000

Therefore, if you run this app in localhost and get CORS errors, please check that your local server is using port 3000.
